# Overview

Implement a RESTful API Server using Express.js in TypeScript. This system allows users to manage a simple todo task list.

## Objectives

1. **Implement Minimal In-Memory Store(s)**

   - Develop a simple class as data storage to manage todo task details.

2. **Develop Basic API Endpoints**

   - Endpoints to list, retrieve, create, update, and delete todo task.

3. **Implement Basic Validation and Error Handling**

   - Validate inputs for API endpoints.
   - Handle errors with appropriate response codes.

4. **Bonus**: Unit Testing with Jest

   - Write unit tests focusing on critical business logic.

5. **Bonus**: Replace In-Memory Store(s) with MongoDB.

## Requirements

- TypeScript and ES6+ code.
- Emphasis on maintainability and understandable code structure.
- Flexibility to modify the provided starter code.
- For bonus objectives, a brief explanation of your solution and design choices is sufficient. Implementation is a plus.

## Evaluation Criteria

- **Functionality**: The application should meet the outlined objectives.
- **System Design**: Look for practicality and simplicity in the overall system architecture, with particular attention to how the code is modularized for different routes.
- **Code Quality**: Cleanliness, readability, and documentation.
- **Modularity and Scalability**: Assess how well the solution uses modular design patterns to enhance code scalability and maintenance.
- **Testing**: Coverage and quality of unit tests.
